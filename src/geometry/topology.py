Topology Solver - Group Disconnected Segments into Shapes

Many DXF files (especially from CAD programs) export closed shapes
as disconnected LINE/ARC segments that need to be grouped together.

This module:
1. Groups connected segments into closed shapes
2. Detects and associates holes with parent shapes
3. Handles complex topological relationships
