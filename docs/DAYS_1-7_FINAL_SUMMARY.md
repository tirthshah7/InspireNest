Impact: Collision detection fails
Solution: Normalize ALL to origin before nesting
Result: From 0% → 13% utilization!
```

```
Good match (rectangles): 9.17% (99.7% efficiency)
Poor match (circles): 13% (27% efficiency)
Difference: 3.7x in efficiency!

Lesson: Always match sheet to part mix
```

### **3. Multi-Pass Works for Complex Files** ✅
```
Simple (rectangles): No benefit (already optimal)
Complex (circles): +60% utilization!
Lesson: Use multi-pass for complex scenarios
```

### **4. Speed vs Quality Trade-off** ⚖️
```
Fast Optimal: 170ms/part, 9.17% util
Multi-Pass: 1000ms/part, 13% util
Trade-off: 6x slower for 42% better quality
Lesson: Choose based on production needs
