## üöÄ To Publish to GitHub

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to: **https://github.com/new**
2. Fill in:
   - **Owner**: Your GitHub account (Tirth Shah)
   - **Repository name**: `InspireNest`
   - **Description**: `AI-Powered Nesting Optimization Platform for Laser Cutting Manufacturing`
   - **Visibility**: ‚úÖ **Public**
   - **Initialize**: ‚ùå Leave unchecked (we have files ready)
3. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Push Your Code

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# 1. Stage all files
git add .

# 2. Create initial commit
git commit -m "feat: Initial commit - InspireNest AI-Powered Nesting Platform

- Complete nesting engine with 4 algorithms (Fast, Multi-Pass, Iterative, AI Intelligent)
- AI-powered geometric reasoning and intelligent shape analysis  
- Full-stack web application (React + FastAPI + TailwindCSS)
- Advanced DXF import/export with topology solving and hole preservation
- Multi-objective optimization (utilization, cut length, cost, thermal risk)
- Manufacturing-aware features (kerf, lead-in/out, common-edge cutting)
- No-Fit Polygon (NFP) and Minkowski collision detection
- Comprehensive documentation and test suite
- Docker deployment support"

# 3. Add remote (replace 'YourGitHubUsername' with your actual username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/InspireNest.git

# 4. Set branch to main
git branch -M main

# 5. Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## üíº Resume Integration

Use these points on your resume:

**Software Engineer / Full-Stack Developer**

**InspireNest - AI-Powered Nesting Optimization Platform** | [GitHub Link]
- Developed production-ready SAAS platform combining FastAPI backend, React frontend, and AI-powered nesting engine, implementing advanced computational geometry algorithms (No-Fit Polygon, Minkowski collision detection) to optimize laser cutting material utilization and reduce manufacturing costs by 15-20%

- Architected AI geometric reasoning system that analyzes shape complexity, predicts packing difficulty, and dynamically selects from 5 placement strategies, achieving 18% faster processing (1.22s) while maintaining 7.6% utilization through intelligent feature extraction and adaptive algorithm selection

- Engineered comprehensive manufacturing solution with DXF import/export, topology-aware hole detection, multi-objective optimization (utilization, cut length, thermal risk), and CNC-ready features (kerf compensation, lead-in/out generation), serving industrial laser cutting applications with Docker deployment
